		<li>Answers should begin with a 3 digit question number followed by a space and then your actual answer to the question.</li>
		<li>Answers are case-insensitive and will only ever use letters, numbers, colons and hyphens.  No other punctuation will be accepted.</li>
		<li>When you submit a correct answer, you will see a confirmation and a new clue.</li>
		<li>An answer is always incorrect if matched with a non-existent or incorrect question number.</li>
		<li>The question numbers you receive will not be in order.</li>
		<li>Correct answers need to be specific.  There is some room for error (e.g. extra spaces are generally ignored) but not much.</li>
		<li>If you're sure an answer is correct but it isn't working, double check everything.  Worst case, you can ask Eric.</li>
		<li>Some questions may have more than one correct answer.  Sometimes different answers will give different results.</li>
