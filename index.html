		<li>Answers should begin with a <font class="blue-text">1-5 digit question number</font> followed by a space and then your <b>actual answer</b> to the question.</li>
		<li>Answers are case-insensitive and will only ever use letters, numbers, spaces, colons and hyphens.  No other punctuation will be accepted.</li>
		<li>When you submit a correct answer, you will see a new question or clue.</li>
		<li>An answer is always incorrect if matched with a non-existent or incorrect <font class="blue-text">question number</font>.</li>
		<li>The <font class="blue-text">question numbers</font> you receive will not be in order.</li>
		<li>Finding the correct <font class="blue-text">question number</font> is usually a part of the puzzle.</li>
		<li>Correct answers need to be specific.  There is some room for error (e.g. extra spaces are generally ignored) but not much.</li>
		<li>If you're sure an answer is correct but it isn't working, double check everything.  Worst case, you can ask Eric.</li>
		<li>Some questions may have more than one correct answer.  Different correct answers will give different results.</li>
		<li>All answers can be found in the church or using materials in the church.  Don't search online.</li>
		<li>There are no clues in the New Basement (where the Faith Explorers are), Fellowship Hall, Kitchen, Office, or any washrooms.</li>
		<li>Remember that most of our lessons have been in the book of Matthew.</li>
